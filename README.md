#### Project title: A snapshot of net overseas migration and housing prices in Australia between June 2013 - December 2021


#### Research questions:

Based on the migration data, what is the highest and lowest states/territories impacted by housing prices between 2013-2021?
Based on the housing data, what was the highewst and lowest states/territories impacted by ousing prices between 2013-2021?
Is there a correlation between net overseas migration and housing prices.

#### How we worked as a team



This project examines the factors that may impact on housing prices in Australia using the data from June 2013- December 2021. Specifically, we examine whether and how housing prices across Australia may be impacted by the overseas net migration by analysing property price index in each state/territory.

Our initial sample includes ### observations for the quartely housing price indices in eight capital cities in Australia during the period of June 2013 to December 2021. 

The housing data was downloaded from the Australian Bureau of Statistics website where the data for overseas migration during the same period was also downloaded. 

The table below summarise the original data and the final data after merging all the datasets.

Before conducting our analyses to answer the project questions, we conduct the following data cleasing and data exploration.

# Data cleansing



## Calculated quartiles for all the variables of our primary interests, the housing prices, the net overseas migration, the number of population, and the interest rates, and created box plots to identify any potential outliers.


# Sort the final dataset to identify the capital cities with the highest and lowest house prices.


# Generated "Summary Statistics" as shown in the Table below.


# Created bar charts to show


# Created line plots and scatter plots to examine the relatioships between the housing price indices and the factors that may impact on the housing prices.


# Finally, we calculated the correlation coefficients and linear regression models between housing price indices and the three factors respectively. We also plot the linear regression models on top of the previous scatter plots.


As shown in the plots x, y, z, the correlation coefficient on the variable inflation rate is, p-value = , suggesting the higher the inflation rate, the lower the housing prices in general......(an expectation).....
